--- general FYI:

In case you encounter the error "Undefined function or variable 'brainSheet'" with the SampleWorkspace please simply run a GLM model 
before running a ML model (this is to set the correct path in your system - this should do the trick!).



---- Known Bugs on Windows and MAC with Matlab 2017 and ElasticNet machine learning -----------

If you experience problems with ElasticNet on MAC (e.g. Matlab freezes) please try switching to the original MEX file (glmnetMex.mexmaci64_old)
under 'GraphVar_2.01\src\ext\glmnet_matlab\'. To do so remove the suffix 'old' (glmnetMex.mexmaci64_old) and delete the duplicate file (which is a newly compiled file).

--------------------------------------------------
WHY SHOULD I DO THIS?
--------------------------------------------------

This GraphVar version contains a compiled version of Glmnet for Matlab (glmnetMex.mexmaci64_old)

provided here:
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/download.html

As this mex file was compiled under Matlab 2012a we experienced compatibility issues when
running ElasticNet models on MAC and Windows with newer Matlab versions (2017). On MAC the file
appears as invalid and on Windows ElasticNet may crash in some cases and cause Matlab to freeze.

We have compiled a new MEX file for MAC, which should solve this problem. If this new file fails to work try the original one.
If the original one does not work please downgrade to an older Matlab version or use Ubuntu/Linux systems
(here we did not experience any issues).
